In other words, it's an estimate of the global warming\nimpact of over the entire lifetime of the construction object.\n\nBuilding LCAs are usually divided into the three phases according to various\nstardards such as EN 15978\n\n  * A: construction\n  * B: operation\n  * C: end-of-life (demolition)\n\nAccording to the standards, each of these phases are again separated into\nnumbered phases, for example A1: extraction of raw materials, A2: transport of\nraw materials, and A3: manufacturing, and so on.\n\n## What is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)? \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/about/carbon-footprint-basics.html#what-is-life-cycle-assessment-lca)\n\nLife Cycle Assessment is a methodology to assess the environmental impact of a\nproduct/building or service throughout its entire life cycle. The core\nmethodology of LCA is stadardized in ISO 14040/44.\n\nThe life cycle is categorized in those phases:\n\n  * (A) production + construction\n  * (B) operational use\n  * (C) end-of-life\n  * (D) beyond\n\nIt helps measure factors like energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n* * *\n\n## What are the important elements of a building/infrastructure LCA? \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/about/carbon-footprint-basics.html#what-are-the-important-elements-of-a-building-infrastructure-lca)\n\n### Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/about/carbon-footprint-basics.html#environmental-product-declaration-epd)\n\nReduzer's product and component library is in large parts based environmental\ninformation from EPDs.\n\nEPD stands for \"Environmental Product Declaration\" and is a standardized\nthird-party certified document that provides information about the\nenvironmental performance of a product over its entire life cycle. The EPDs\nare often the main data source for the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) calculation\nand offer data to environmental impact categories, such as:\n\n  * Global Warming potential (GWP [kgCO2eq])\n  * Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP [kgCFC11eq])\n  * PhotochemicalOzoneCreationPotential (POCP [kgC2H4eq])\n  * AcidificationPotential (AP [kgSO2eq])\n  * EutrophicationPotential (EP [kgSO2eq])\n  * Water usage\n  * Life span\n\n### Further reading \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/about/carbon-footprint-basics.html#further-reading)\n\n  * [Products in reduzer](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/features/materials.html)\n\n* * *\n\n### Life span \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/about/carbon-footprint-basics.html#life-span)\n\nThe LCA calculation methods for the life spans of buildings are usually set to\n50 or 60 years, in order to be able to compare it with other projects. In\nother words, the calculation assumes that the building will be demolished\nafter 50 or 60 years (hopefully not in real life!) and calculates all\nemissions from production, operation to end of life.\n\nProducts on the other side might have a shorter life span.\n\nFor example photovoltaic panels have a rough service life of 30 years and need\nto be replaced.\n\nThe life span is a huge factor that can change the outcome of emissions- be\naware! The goal is to use materials which are durable, last longer, and\ndoesn't need to be replaced.\n\n### Further reading \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/about/carbon-footprint-basics.html#further-reading)\n\n  * [Products in reduzer](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/features/materials.html)\n\n* * *\n\n## How is the calculation done? \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/about/carbon-footprint-basics.html#how-is-the-calculation-done)\n\nYou don't have to worry about the calculations, that is taken care of by the\nsoftware. However, if your are intersted, here is some more information:\n\n### Calculation methods (schemes) \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/about/carbon-footprint-basics.html#calculation-methods-schemes)\n\nThere are many different schemes on how to calculate the LCA:\n\n  * BREEAM\n  * TEK17\n  * NS3720\n  * FutureBuilt Zero\n  * DNGB\n  * ...\n\nTo be able to compare the results you must always compare the same scheme.\n\nWith Reduzer you can change the scheme easily with one click.\n\nWhere to change the scheme:\n\nOn most pages its found on the top right corner.\n\n## Overview of the differences between the schemes \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/about/carbon-footprint-basics.html#overview-of-the-differences-between-the-schemes)\n\nCareful! Some calculation methods use different life spans. For example, the\nNS3720 uses 60 years while the german DNGB calculation uses 50 years. This has\nan big impact on the emission results.\n\n### Further reading \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/about/carbon-footprint-basics.html#further-reading)\n\n[Schemes in reduzer](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/features/schemes-+-LCA-calculation.html)\n\n* * *\n\n"

These versions can be sorted within the different construction phases for better organization and tracking.\n\n### Versions \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/basics/navigation-in-reduzer.html#versions)\n\nVersions of a Construction Object are independent variations of the design,\nand can be used to create alternatives. You can at any time create a duplicate\nof an existing version, and then make edits to the duplicate to investigate\nhow that changes the results. Each version belongs to a project phase. Project\nphases are simply a way to organize your versions as the design develops over\ntime.\n\n### Main version \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/basics/navigation-in-reduzer.html#main-version)\n\nEach Construction Object should have a main version. The main version is used\nwhen dispalying results for the Construction Object, and when displaing\nresults for the Project as a whole. You can mark a version as Main by clicking\nthe star icon. In each project phase, you can designate one Starred version\n(or none). The Starred version from the latest project phase becomes the main\nversion, and is used in the results when comparing construction objects, and\nin the project results.\n\n### Contents of a version \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/basics/navigation-in-reduzer.html#contents-of-a-version)\n\nA version can have Materials, Energy use, and Travel added to it. You can of\ncourse add these manually if you wish, but reduzer also makes it easy to\nautomatically add or import the data while creating a new version.\n\n### Design parameters \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/basics/navigation-in-reduzer.html#design-parameters)\n\nA version also has Design parameters. Design parameters are a quick and\nconvenient way to make changes to a version without having to change the\ncontent manually. Some examples of design parameters are floor areas, number\nof stories, external wall areas, window areas, slab areas, and many more. As\nlong as the contents of the version are linked with the design parameters, a\nchange in a design parameter will automatically update the contents.\n\n## Libraries \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/basics/navigation-in-reduzer.html#libraries)\n\nIn the libraries, you will find the data you need to do the calculations.\nHere, you can for example compare the emissions of different products and\ncomponents.\n\nThere are four libraries: Product, Component, Template, and Activities\n(coming).\n\nEach library is divided into a Global, Company, and My library:\n\n  * Global library: This is the main library, and the data is managed by reduzer\n  * Company library: Shared with all users of your company account, and you, as the users, are the managers of this library\n  * My library: This is your personal user library. Only you have access.\n\n"

All common\nschemes are readily available in Reduzer, so you don't need to worry about the\ndetails.\n\nAll calculations shown in Reduzer, both in [projects](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/projects.html) and in\nthe [libraries](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/libraries.html), are always according to the currently\nselected scheme. A key benefit of Reduzer is that you can easily and quickly\nswitch between schemes, at any time, in the scheme menu. Results will\nautomatically be recalculated.\n\nDetails\n\nYou can also create custom schemes, with custom system boundaries, calculation\nmethods, and benchmarks. (insert link to separate page in User Guide\nexplaining everything about custom schemes)\n\n## Where can schemes be found in Reduzer? \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/features/schemes-+-LCA-calculation.html#where-can-schemes-be-found-in-reduzer)\n\nWhere\n\nlajd. Can we use this structure on most pages:\n\n  * Page title and introduction\n  * Where can X be found in Reduzer?\n  * How to use X \n\nSchemes can be found in one most pages in Reduzer. At least one scheme must be\nselected when creating a new project in the `+ Add new project` dialog. This\ncan later be changed in the `Edit project` dialog.\n\nWhen a project is opened, you will see the Scheme menu on the top right.\n\nThe same Scheme menu can be found in all [libraries](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/libraries.html), also\non the top right.\n\n## How to use Schemes \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/features/schemes-+-LCA-calculation.html#how-to-use-schemes)\n\n## Further reading \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/features/schemes-+-LCA-calculation.html#further-reading)\n\nLinks to other pages touching on schemes.\n\n### Scheme constituents \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/features/schemes-+-LCA-calculation.html#scheme-constituents)\n\nA scheme consists of system boundaries, calculation methods, and benchmarks.\n\n### Calculation method \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/features/schemes-+-LCA-calculation.html#calculation-method)\n\n### System boundary \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/features/schemes-+-LCA-calculation.html#system-boundary)\n\n### Benchmark \u200b [\u200b](https://docs.reduzer.com/en/features/schemes-+-LCA-calculation.html#benchmark)\n\n"
